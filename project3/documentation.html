		<h1>Project 3 Retrospective</h1>
		
		<p>I created this project using base code from one of the svg excercises we did in class, but
		heavily modified. I used the same mouse control scheme used in class and wrote new methods for
		processing player input through keyboard buttons and enemy spawning algorithms. The scaling difficulty
		uses a chain of setInterval() methods that run until they call the next one, picking up the pace of the game.
		I used several different versions of two sprites to represent the player and enemy in the game. Both were taken
		from the internet and palette swapped by me to better represent the different in game colors.</p>
		<p>For this project, I learned a lot about swapping around svg elements that are being used. Every state
		of the game uses an svg element tag, but I used classList.toggle() to keep switching what was being
		processed by the browser and what wasnt. By using a simple CSS rule that changes the display of an
		element to display:none, I was able to turn parts on and off. Another major element
		of the project was learning how to use setInterval() properly to make the difficulty scale and
		change other elements as the game advances. Lastly, I also learned how to use svg pattern elements
		to create image backgrounds for the svg elements in the game.</p>
		<p>I can see quite a few ways I would enhance the game. I wanted to use multiple backgrounds for
		the main menu's screens, the game screen and the game over screens, but many of the pictures I wanted
		to use couldn't be easily converted to svg's to be usable for patterns. In the future, I would love 
		to be able to make my own svg elements instead of borrowing others content. I also would have liked
		to add more actual game elements, such as enemies that have to be dodged instead of killed, powerups,
		enemies with more health, etc. </p>
